## Project Motivation
This capstone project to complete the Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree Program. Starbucks has provided the simulated data that mimics the customers' behavior on different kinds of rewards sent through the mobile app. I have developed a machine learning model to 1) find the offer that a customer ends up un buying the products. 2) find the customer who buys the product without the influence of the offer. The description of the entire process adopted can be found in the file ** project_capstone**.

## Files Descriptions

The enitre process adopted are carried out in four notebooks.
    
        1.  Data_exploration.ipynb: Data exploration is carried out in this notebook.
        2.  Data_cleaning.ipynb: Data cleaning and feature engineering is carried out in this notebook.
        3.  EDA.ipynb: Exploratory data analysis of the cleaned data is carried out in this notebook.
        4.  Data_modeling: Data scaling and machine learning models are trained in this notebook
        
        The data files are explained in details in the notebooks as well as in the 'project_capstone' file.
